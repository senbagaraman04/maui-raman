<!--AppShell.xaml. This file is the main structure of a .NET MAUI application.
    The .NET MAUI Shell provides many features that are beneficial 
    for multiple-platform apps including app styling, URI based navigation, 
    and layout options including flyout navigation and tabs for the root of the application.
    The default template provides a single page (or ShellContent) that is inflated when the app starts.-->
