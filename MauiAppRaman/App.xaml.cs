    //App.xaml.cs.This is the code-behind for the App.xaml file.
    //This file defines the App class. This class represents
    //your application at runtime.The constructor in this class creates an
    //initial window and assigns it to the MainPage property; this property determines
    //which page is displayed when the application starts running.Additionally, this class
    //enables you to override common platform-neutral application lifecycle event handlers.
    //Events include OnStart, OnResume, and OnSleep.
    //These handlers are defined as members of the Application base class. The code below shows examples:
    public App()
    {
        InitializeComponent();
        MainPage = new AppShell();
    }
    protected override void OnStart()
    {
        base.OnStart();
    }
    protected override void OnResume()
    {
        base.OnResume();
    }

    protected override void OnSleep()
    {
        base.OnSleep();
    }
}
